IOS application to create a list of Restaurants and Custom Actions using Swift 4

This is one of my IOS applications to review/consolidate/learn Swift 4 code concepts and the use of Xcode and maybe in a future be used as a placeholder for my personal projects

This app is taken from a learning resource.
